## Netflix Clone

Welcome to my Netflix Clone project! In this project, I have recreated the popular streaming service Netflix using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. With this clone, you can enjoy the same user experience and design as the original website, but with the added bonus of building it yourself!

## Description

This front-end web application features a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes, and includes sections for browsing popular movies and TV shows, viewing trailers, and signing up for a subscription. With smooth scrolling and animations, the Netflix Clone is as fun to navigate as it is to use.

## Installation

To run the project, simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser. That's it! No complicated installations or setup required.

## Usage

With the Netflix Clone, you can browse a selection of movies and TV shows, view trailers, and sign up for a subscription, all while experiencing the same polished design and functionality as the real Netflix website.
